Whether for personal or project use, this script streamlines backup tasks, ensuring data integrity and security.

**Tools used:** `cp` , `rsync` , `mkdir` , `tar` , `echo`

**Skills Demonstarted:**
- File Management
- Data Backup
- Error Handling
- Cron Jobs (if added to cron)

```bash
bash backup.sh /path/to/folder
#!/bin/bash
# backup.sh - Folder backup script
# if loop for usage of folder
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 /path/to/folder"
  exit 1
fi

FOLDER=$1
#if loop to check if folder exists, if not it gives an error message
if [ ! -d "$FOLDER" ]; then
  echo "Error: $FOLDER does not exist or is not a directory."
  exit 2
fi

DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
ARCHIVE="backup_$(basename "$FOLDER")_$DATE.tar.gz"

tar -czf  "$ARCHIVE" "$FOLDER"
#tarball for archiving the folder
echo "[+] Backup saved as $ARCHIVE"
```
[Backup.sh can be found here](/Bash-Tools//backup.sh)
**If adding a Cron job (OPTIONAL)**
To add to Cron Jobs: (This example will be for midnight)
- Download Backup.sh, in your terminal do [chmod +x /path/to/backup.sh]
- [crontab -e] (This will open your crontab file)
- In your file add [0 0 * * * /path/to/backup.sh /path/to/folder]
- Save and quit
- Optional: Check your cron logs, [grep CRON /var/log/syslog]

Other use cases:
- Every hour [0 * * * * /path/to/backup.sh /path/to/folder]
- Every Sunday at 2 am [0 2 * * 0 /path/to/backup.sh /path/to/folder]
