# Hello and 👋 Welcome

I'm **Ellie Levey** — a cybersecurity professional with experience in scripting, systems, and security analysis.  
I combine a background in **cloud data infrastructure** with **IBM mainframe systems** (REXX, COBOL) to understand security at every layer — from legacy enterprise code to modern containerized environments.  

My experience spans **program management, automation, and applied research** in vulnerability discovery, reverse engineering, and forensics. I love finding the connections between systems others often overlook — the quirks, misconfigurations, and hidden behaviors that shape real-world security.  

I'm currently pursuing advanced security research focused on **cross-platform vulnerability analysis, malware triage, and detection engineering**.

**Languages & Tools:**  
Python • Bash • REXX • C/C++ (basics) • COBOL • PowerShell • HTML • CSS • Java • PHP • YAML • JSON • XML • Markdown • XAMPP • Docker • Kubernetes  

**Research Focus:**  
Securing data storage systems and medical equipment — the overlooked layers that keep the world running.  
When these systems fail, the impact is immediate. When they’re protected, everything else stands stronger.
