# ðŸ§ƒSecurity Tools
Welcome to my list of security tools I've used over time, some of them are still a bit new to me while others I have used for a long time. Most of these I found myself or used in a class, however I don't think classes go in depth enough to fully learn or understand the tools used. Nothing against classes but I like to know more about my tools than what's at the surface.
